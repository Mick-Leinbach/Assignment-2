# Assignment-2
This program is not complicated. It gives you the option to look at either the linked list I made or the stack I made. Enter 1 to see the linked list and 2 to see the stack. The program will have to be restarted at least once if you want to see both.
Once you select a stack, the program will occasionally ask for integer inputs as it goes through the functions that I have coded it. That's all there is to it. No morbid storyline this time, unfortunately.
